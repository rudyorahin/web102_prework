## Notes

While building the app, I encountered several challenges that provided valuable learning experiences. One of the primary challenges was implementing the dynamic filtering functionality in the "Our Games" section. Ensuring that the filters for funded and unfunded games worked correctly required a careful approach to JavaScript array manipulation and DOM updates.

Another challenge was in designing a responsive and visually appealing layout. Balancing aesthetics with functionality, especially ensuring the website was responsive and accessible on various devices, required meticulous CSS adjustments and testing.

Additionally, integrating a search feature posed its own set of challenges, particularly in efficiently searching and updating the UI without affecting performance. This involved understanding and implementing efficient search algorithms and handling user input dynamically.

Lastly, managing and organizing the code to keep it maintainable and readable was a continuous task. As the app grew in complexity, refactoring and organizing code to ensure scalability became increasingly important. This involved applying best practices in code structure and design patterns.

Overall, these challenges were instrumental in enhancing my skills in web development, particularly in JavaScript, CSS, and responsive design.
